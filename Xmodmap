!run the tool xev to see the keycodes

! unbind physical left ctrl key (keysym was determined by xev)
keycode 37 = 
! a more generic way to achieve the same is
! keysym Control_L = (does not work)


!keycode 151 = Super_L
!clear mod4
!add mod4 = Super_L
!keycode 151 = Caps_Lock
!clear lock
!add mod4 = Caps_Lock

!remove Lock = Caps_Lock
