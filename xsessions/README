change paths in *.desktop files to current directory
cp the desktop files to /usr/share/xessions (gdm or any other
standards-compliant DM will look in this dir for xession files)

if you are using some distribution that comes with gnome3 instead of
gnome 2 then copy the awesome.session file to
/usr/share/gnome-sessions/sessions

look into .xsession-errors in case of errors
